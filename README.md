Undying Havoc is a survival game set in a post-apocalyptic world, developed as a college project by a dedicated team led by the Lead Game Developer. The game challenges players to endure relentless zombie attacks while managing resources and building a fortified base.

## Unique Features

- **Dynamic Resource Spawning:** Resources appear in varying locations and quantities, ensuring each playthrough is unique and challenging.
- **Dynamic Grid System:** The game world utilizes a flexible grid system for building and resource placement, allowing for creative base construction and tactical planning.
- **Extensive Use of Scriptable Objects:** Game data and behaviors are managed using Unityâ€™s Scriptable Objects, enabling modularity and scalability.
- **Object Pooling for Optimization:** Performance is enhanced through object pooling, reducing overhead from frequent instantiation and destruction of game objects.

## About the Game

In Undying Havoc, you are stranded in a hostile environment where survival depends on your ability to adapt and strategize. By day, explore the world to gather resources and reinforce your base. By night, defend your oxygen generator from waves of zombies that grow stronger and more numerous as the game progresses. Upgrade your weapons, fortify your defenses, and use quick thinking to survive each night.
